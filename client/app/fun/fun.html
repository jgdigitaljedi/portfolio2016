			I think of this site less as just a portfolio and more of a personal playground.
			That said, I occasionally tinker on something that I wouldn't mind sharing with the rest of the world.
			This is where I'll be sharing that stuff! Below are some apps that I've created for fun. Enjoy!

						This is just a little 2048 game I developed. I had never really done any game development and figured this
						would be an easy one to get me going. I used this as an opportunity to explore Phaser which is a sort of
						game engine for JavaScript. After getting a feel for what Phaser does, I can definitely say that I'll be
						using this to create more little games in the future. Make sure to enter your name because this is hooked up
						to a little database that will store the highest score!

						A few years ago while attending MakerSquare I participated in a short hackathon. I was on a team with a couple
						of other guys and we had a fifteen minute debate about where to eat lunch the day before. That inspired us to write
						something that would settle future debates and just tell us where to eat based off of location and call it Restaurant
						Roulette. Years later I still liked the idea and knew I had enough knowledge to do it a lot better. This is the result,
						hence the name Restaurant Roulette Remix. Put and end to those "where should we eat" arguments!

        Also, it might be kind of interesting to some folks to see my video game collection. I threw together some
        data tables for myself so I could see what I had already or remind myself of things I decided I wanted to add
        to the collection soon. I realized that some folks might find it interesting as well. You can view my collection
