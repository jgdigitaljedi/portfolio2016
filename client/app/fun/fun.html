        A few years ago while attending MakerSquare I participated in a short hackathon. I was on a team with a couple
        of other guys and we had a fifteen minute debate about where to eat lunch the day before. That inspired us to write
        something that would settle future debates and just tell us where to eat based off of location and call it Restaurant
        Roulette. Years later I still liked the idea and knew I had enough knowledge to do it a lot better. This is the result,
        hence the name Restaurant Roulette Remix. Put and end to those "where should we eat" arguments!

        This is just a little 2048 game I developed. I had never really done any game development and figured this
        would be an easy one to get me going. I used this as an opportunity to explore Phaser which is a sort of
        game engine for JavaScript. After getting a feel for what Phaser does, I can definitely say that I'll be
        using this to create more little games in the future. Make sure to enter your name because this is hooked up
        to a little database that will store the highest score!

        Also, it might be kind of interesting to some folks to see my video game collection. I threw together some
        data tables for myself so I could see what I had already and remind myself of things I decided I wanted to add
        to the collection soon. My collection is growing fairly quickly so I can keep up with it this way.
        I realized that some folks might find it interesting as well. This was originally developed to be standalone so
        excuse the boring appearance. This is a bit more utilitarian.
